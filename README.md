This work aimed to develop a short-term precipitation forecasting method using deep learning models.
The initial approach involved the use of a recurrent neural network, specifically an LSTM model, with input variables including temperature, relative humidity, 
pressure, precipitable water vapor, cumulative rainfall, and temporal features such as month and day. This model yielded promising results, but its performance 
significantly deteriorated when cumulative rainfall was excluded from the inputs. To address this limitation, a two-stage approach was introduced. In the first 
phase, a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) was used to estimate the instantaneous precipitation intensity. The prediction generated by the RFR model was then incorporated
as an additional input to the LSTM network. This combined approach substantially improved the LSTM model’s performance in scenarios where cumulative rainfall data
was unavailable. The RFR model proved to be effective not only in preprocessing the input data but also in acting as a noise-filtering mechanism, thereby enhancing
the overall robustness of the forecasting system. Furthermore, a particularly valuable insight was the RFR model’s ability to effectively capture the importance of
precipitable water vapor (PWV) in rainfall prediction.
